# Mapping-Tools-redone
This mod allows you to place all terrain features, all improvements, wherever you want, without restrictions.

This code was originally done by Caballero-Arepa, I take no credit besides some updating and alterations.

Some alterations from the original are:

-Fixed forest not giving any production
-Jungles now give 45 production as opposed to forests giving 30 when cut down

-Almost all tile improvements where improved with Technology as the game goes on
